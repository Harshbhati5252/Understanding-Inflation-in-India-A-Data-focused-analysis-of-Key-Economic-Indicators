# Understanding-Inflation-in-India-A-Data-focused-analysis-of-Key-Economic-Indicators
This project aims to check how inflation in India connects with three everyday economic 
indicators: 
● Crude Oil Prices (USD) 
● Food Price Index 
● INR to USD Exchange Rate 
It includes historical data (2010–2023) and forecasts (2025–2030) using a simple 
regression model on clean data. The purpose isn’t perfect prediction, but to observe 
patterns and relationships based on structured data. 
Files Included 
● inflation_predictors.xlsx – historical data 
● inflation_analysis.ipynb – code 
● inflation_forecast_2025_2030.xlsx – future predictions 
● commentary.md – reflection 
● research_paper.md - analysis 
Forecast Section 
I added predictions for Jan 2025 through Dec 2030 using estimated inputs for crude oil, 
food index, and exchange rate. The model was created from 2010–2023 and the 
predictions are shared in a separate file.
